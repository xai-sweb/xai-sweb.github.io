title: Dagstuhl-Style Workshop on XAI with Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs
---

# About the Workshop

This Dagstuhl-style workshop, co-located with ISWC 2025, focuses on Explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of ontologies and knowledge graphs (KGs). It aims to explore how ontology-driven and KG-based AI systems can enhance explainability, trust, and accountability in AI agents. The workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to discuss challenges, opportunities, and best practices for designing transparent and interpretable AI systems that leverage structured knowledge.

## Motivation

As AI agents increasingly process sensitive personal and organizational data, ensuring explainability, ethical alignment, and accountability is paramount. Ontologies and knowledge graphs provide structured representations that can enhance reasoning and transparency in AI systems. This workshop addresses the following key questions:

- How can ontologies and KGs improve the explainability of AI decisions?
- What role do structured knowledge representations play in ensuring user trust?
- How can AI systems balance autonomy with user control over data?
- What are the ethical implications of deploying XAI systems across diverse contexts?

## Discussion Points

1. **Explainability**: How can ontologies and KGs enable interpretable AI models and decision-making processes?
2. **Trust and Transparency**: What mechanisms ensure users trust ontology-driven AI systems?
3. **User Autonomy**: How can KGs empower users to maintain control over their personal data?
4. **Accountability and Ethics**: How can XAI systems be designed to ensure fairness, accountability, and ethical diversity?
